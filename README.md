### Live Preview Link: [https://pa-snip-shop.vercel.app](https://pa-snip-shop.vercel.app)

This is the landing page of `SnipShop` an assessment given by Pioneer Alpha. Here, I have designed the landing page as given in the figma file and I have used `Axios` & `Swiper.js` library to do asynchronous API calls and making sliders accordingly. Moreover, I have used `Tailwind CSS` for designing the whole landing page. I have also changed the favicon and tab title accordingly. I have also added some hover effect in the available buttons.

## Libraries Used

- Tailwind CSS
- React Icons
- Axios
- Swiper.js
